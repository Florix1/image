Project Title
	Image processing


Getting Started
	This project is a request I received with the list of the actual tasks in 
the tasks.txt file.General idea is to bring certain images to a specific format.
	

Prerequisites
	What things you need to install the software and how to install them :

# gifsicle   3*)
	sudo apt-get install gifsicle

# libvips (version 8.2.2 or greater)  1*)
	sudo apt install libvips libvips-dev
	sudo apt install libvips-tools


Running the tests
	make clone => bring the pictures to the current directory
	make clean => remove output pictures
	make run   => runs script and tests for picture size
	make clean_all => removes the cloned images too

Problems during implementation
	Installed libvips with the instructions above and got stuck with the 8.2.2
version (actual stable one is around 8.7).This restricted the functionalities
I had access to so I couldn't use things like --smartcrop or ! when specifing 
size( link 2*) below ).
	The lack of ! was quite important ( ! forces the new image to the specified 
size) and I couldn't resize the pictures to exactly 150x150. I didn't
have time to ask and wait for an answer on this regard so I just
implement it 2 ways : first one crops the image to the lower size (height or 
width) and then scales it. The second one was to scale it out of the bat so the
image is in the 150x150 box but one of its sizes might be lower than 150. 


Break down into end to end tests
	Disclaimer!It was less than a day of work as this project got squeezed in 
between other projects and homework so I apologize in advance for any coding
style inconsistencies, logical blunders and especially Readme typos.
	I used the library that was highlited in the task description and preffered
bash as it can be fast to use and I don't have experience with files managment
in python and learning something else would be too time consuming for me atm.
	I used vipsthumbnail as the size requested was rather small.The main dilema
described above regarding the size pushed me to make 2 versions of the output 
images ( even if the initial image was a square in which the 2 versions are 
identical ).
	The code is quite simple to understand so I will focus on the decision 
making.I keept the images 1 and 5 to their original formats as they are all the
way compatible with the browsers.For images 2 and 4 webp is much more efficient
if it is just chrome compatible and 3 has to be kept a gif.
	Image 3 had no support in 1*) library so I went online and found a simple
fix 3*).I kept animation, transparency, quality (where I could) but I am not 
aware if there should be any more features I should have checked for.
	The script only checks if the size of the bigger picture (version 1) fits
the size described by the tasks.I hope I managed to cover what you had in mind
and thank you for your time!
